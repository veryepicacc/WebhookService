	Other info that may help you with the WebhookService.
	
	Setting up the webhook bot from Discord itself:
	1. Open your discord server
	2. Select any channel, press the cog / settings icon on that channel (assuming you have permissions to do so.)
	3. Go down to integrations.
	4. Select "Create Webhook"
	5. Name it and set the profile picture as you please. (not responsible if you put an inappropriate name or pfp and get moderated in some way.)
	6. Copy the webhook url and place it in the first argument wherever WebhookService:Setup() is used.
	7. The rest of the webhooking is done for you.
	
	Discord has rate limits for Post Requests and expects you as a developer to respect them.
	Post Request Rate Limits: 30 requests per 60 seconds
	
	You can use user functions like you would as a discord user, but in a different way for WebhookService:
	To ping users, put <@user_id> in the first quotes of wherever WebhookService:PostWebhookFunc() is used. (if you are confused on the user_id part, search on your browser "How to get user id for Discord?")
	To ping a certain role, put <@&role_id> (if you are confused on the role_id part, search on your browser "How to get role id for Discord?") in the first quotes of wherever WebhookService:PostWebhookFunc()
	To mention a channel, put <#channel_id> in the first quotes of wherever WebhookService:PostWebhookFunc() is used. (if you are confused on the channel_id part, search on your browser "How to get channel id for Discord?")
	To say an emoji, put <:emoji_name:emoji_id> in the first quotes of wherever WebhookService:PostWebhookFunc() is used. (if you are confused on the emoji_name:emoji_id part, search on your browser "How to get emoji id for Discord?")
