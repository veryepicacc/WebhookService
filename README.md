# WebhookService
WebhookService is a roblox-discord api module for the use of discord server webhooks. The current discord rate limits which are 30 requests per 60 seconds, will have to be taken into account by the user for the sake of avoiding discord termination for the reason of excessive requests. (STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!!!)
